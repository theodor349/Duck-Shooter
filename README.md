# Duck-Shooter
This is example code for the Blogpost by Tomasz Piowczyk over at connect.unity.com. And I made this because he used an example to show how the new Unity ECS system works but did not have a code example.  The blogpost can be found at https://connect.unity.com/p/part-1-unity-ecs-briefly-about-ecs

What I learned:
- Unity's new ECS system
- Entity Component System workflow
